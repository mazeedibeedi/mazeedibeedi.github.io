title: My Experience with Bloc
---
I started working with Bloc in late December 2016, after one of my partners recommended I take it. He recommended I take it to help further my programming and CS experience, as it would prove to be useful in the startup that we’re working on. 

## BB (Before Bloc)
Before I started with Bloc, I had completed my Masters in Computer Science at the University of Birkbeck in London in 2015, only knowing Java and Scala. This was before I was introduced to the Web 2.0 world. Once I decided with my colleagues to focus our development efforts on Ruby on Rails, I was encouraged to start learning Ruby on Rails. 

I started off with the Michael Hartl book, “The Ruby on Rails Tutorial”. I was impressed with the kinds of the functions and automation that you can achieve with it, comparing it back to when I was working with Java, and wished that I started learning it a lot earlier in my career. 

After I completed the book, I was hungry for more, but was burdened by the work of the startup that I setup with my partners. After months of work, I finally committed myself to seriously improving my programming career and started work on Bloc

## WB (With Bloc)
From the very first day I started with Bloc, I was introduced to many frontend concepts at blinding speed. My mentor at the time, Chris Beck, was incredibly helpful and responsive to any questions that I had, even going out of his way to take a bit extra time from our scheduled meeting to help me.

While I was working through the frontend fundamentals, I had a much easier time with working on JavaScript than I did with HTML and CSS, since it has a similar syntax and process to my already familiar knowledge of Java. The only problem I had with JavaScript was trying to wrap my head around how dynamic it was compared with Java.

I struggled the most with CSS, since it was very difficult for me to think like a designer and to remember all the properties associated with it. I still struggle a bit with CSS, when it comes to how a website should look and respond to the functionalities of a website.

After completing the frontend fundamentals module, I had to change my mentor to Mark Carpenter, who has not stopped helping me since I started the day we met. Together with Mark, we worked through the Frontend Web Development Module and managed to complete websites that I’m proud of showing off to my friends and family. 

I was introduced to a whole new world of frontend development; DOM, Media Queries, jQuery, AngularJs and Firebase. I was also exposed to the kinds of decision making that a developer would have to make when it comes with choosing their tools, for example, choosing jQuery or AngularJs or even both. Now, I made it a hobby of mine to see what kinds of technologies a website uses, whether it’s jQuery, or Angular, or even React.

Through a lot of encouragement from both my mentors, I decided to start actively being involved in the programming communities and am currently going to be at RubyHack and RailsConf. For anyone reading this and going to any of these conferences, it’d be great to meet you and chat over some coffee!

## My takeaway from this experience
Had I self-taught myself, I doubt I would have gotten very far. Now that I have gotten a taste of what the frontend world is about, I can now start my frontend career the right way. Bloc has helped to develop my vocabulary and to expand my horizons. 

This, of course, did come with many frustrations; being able to meet deadline and work a demanding full-time job was not easy. With the help and guidance of my mentors, it made it a lot easier for me to manage. I’m very excited with what Bloc has to offer next, and I’m more determined than ever to achieve whatever goals they set.
