title: My Goals as a Frontend Developer
---

Having just recently completed Bloc's Frontend Web Development Module, I thought it would be a good idea to talk about where I was before completing it and what my new goals are as a frontend developer. This is just a simple blog post about my ambitions as a frontend developer, with a bit of backstory of what I had done previously to Bloc.

## My (Programming) Life story

In 2015, I graduated with a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Birkbeck, having just left with experience in Java and Scala. I had no proper frontend experience, except for the odd HTML classes I did back in high school.  I knew about CSS, but that looked like pure wizardry with no logic. I think the Family Guy gif summed up my experience with CSS perfectly. 

## How Bloc Exposed me to the Frontend World

I started working with Bloc in late December 2016, with nothing more than my Java and Scala experience. With the help of my mentors and the curriculum, I started to slowly expand my knowledge and exposure of the frontend world, to the point where I’m comfortable with reading codebases from different websites, hell, even excited to see what technologies that many of my favorite websites are using. 

Because of Bloc, I’ve been exposed to JavaScript, AngularJS and jQuery, as well as technologies like Firebase. I learned about how HTML5 and CSS3 evolved to suit the ever growing and always connected and mobile world. 

My mentor, Mark Carpenter, even sparked my interest with the new technologies on the horizon such as React Native and Angular 4, which has made me even determined to forge my skills as a frontend developer.

## My Goals as a Frontend Developer

These past few months have been great as I’ve been exposed to the kinds of technologies that many frontend developer uses as well as help me to come up with my goals that I know I’ll achieve one day. 

I hope that one day I can create responsive and clean looking websites for myself and for other people. 

I’m even more determined to learn about the newest and latest technologies such as React Native and Angular 4, and what may come afterwards, as I know this will help me to stand apart as a developer. 

## Steps I’ve already taken towards my goals

I now have three frontend projects completed under my belt. They may not be perfect or even look as good as I would hope, but they are a big step for me to pursue my goals as a full-stack developer as I have tangibles to refer to.
