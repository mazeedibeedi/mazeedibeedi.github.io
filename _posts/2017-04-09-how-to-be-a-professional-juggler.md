title: How to be a Professional Juggler
---
Not everything is filled with sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes you need to learn how to juggle to get the results you want. While learning how to develop, I ran into several speedbumps that halted my progress. However, the biggest hurdle I’ve had to face, and still currently face, is being able to find the time to learn and to work at my startup fulltime. 

## My Startup

My fulltime job is in a startup based in Kuwait called TONS. It’s an on-demand grocery application for Kuwait. Our application is a native iOS app with a Ruby on Rails backend. 

This is by far the most interesting and exciting project that I have ever been involved with in my entire career. We’re a very small and lean team of about 5 people, who are just as motivated and excited as I am in delivering the application. 

This, of course, is where most of my time is dedicated towards. This takes over days, weeks and months of my time.

## Now with added Bloc

My decision to start studying with Bloc came from a recommendation from one of my partners. Being the only one on the team with any programming and CS experience, I was eager to join the cause and to help develop my skills alongside with TONS. 

This decision was not taken lightly, I had to make some sacrifices to commit to working on both TONS and Bloc. 

Initially, I decided that it would be best for me to start working on this after I get back home from work. Big mistake on my part. I haven’t anticipated that we would be working a lot longer hours at work since we started operating, I even had to put out fires (figuratively!) from TONS at home. 

This is a job that demands a lot of attention, and this wasn’t going to cut it

## From Chaos Comes Order

From this experience, I started to notice a pattern. Most emergencies that require immediate attention to on TONS tend to happen late at night, since most of our users order while on their way back from work. 

I also noticed that many of my partners are not in their offices until around 3pm. After discussing with my partners about moving forward with both Bloc and TONS, we concluded that I can dedicate 2-3 hours while at the office undisturbed. 

I had to arrive before my other partners arrived and could use their space for undisturbed learning.
After some adjustments and getting used to, this happened to be the better solution. I managed to get a lot more completed, and was going at a good pace. 

However, this was not the perfect solution, as I still had to take care of any emergencies that happened during my studies, making it a bit difficult to get back to the momentum. Like the software world, I’ll have to keep iterating my approach till I get it right, and I’m confident that I’ll achieve it eventually.
